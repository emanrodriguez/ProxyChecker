# FAQ
**1.What's a proxy?**
   1. "A proxy is an intermediary between your main computer IP and the retailer websites that allows you to mask your IP and avoid getting banned. Proxies have their own IP addresses, so the website will be seeing a task constantly spamming with the proxy IP instead of yours, which leads to not getting your local IP Banned. Having multiple proxies allows you to create hundreds or thousands of tasks since each task will have a different IP." -

**2.Why does proxy score matter?**
   1. A proxy score matters because every IP Address has a risk score that is given to a website. The lower the score the more freedom you have to browse a website
      1. Example includes:
         1. If your proxy has a risk score of 50-100 you will not be able to create an account with specific websites
         1. Error messages will come up when trying to view a webpage
         1. You're request to ping a website will be rejected
